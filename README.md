# rnamods-nf

This repository contains nextflow pipeline that I created to process the data from direct RNA sequencing using nanopore sequencer - MinION - specifically identifying RNA modifications.

## Requirements to run the pipeline

1. Fastq files for 3 biological replicates for both native and in vitro RNA of a bacterial strain
2. Folders containing references for the bacteria
3. Folders containing fast5 files for each replicate
